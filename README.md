## Project Name : Melanoma_Detection_Assignment

### Problem Statetment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### Dataset used
The problem can be solved using the dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

### Steps for Model Building
1.Reading and Understanding Data  
2.Visualising the Data  
3.Data Preparation  
4.Model Building and Training  
5.Data Augmentation  
6.Class Distribution 
7.Handling Class imbalances  
8.Final Result Analysis
